Custom step — Meeting Scheduler (Agent 07)
P5 responsibility

What it does:
    Receives calendar availability data fetched by the preceding DBExtractor step.
    Scores each available time slot by participant overlap — how many of the required
    participants are free for that slot. Returns the top N ranked proposals.

    Scoring logic:
        overlap_score = free_participants / total_participants
        Slots are ranked descending by overlap_score.
        Ties are broken by time of day preference (earlier in working hours = higher rank).
        Slots with overlap_score < 1.0 are included but marked as partial.
        Only slots with at least one free participant are returned.

Returns:
    StepResult.data = {
        "proposed_slots": list[dict],   # ranked, max length = config.max_proposals
        "total_slots_evaluated": int,
        "all_free_slot_found": bool,    # True if any slot has overlap_score == 1.0
    }

    Each slot dict:
        {
            "slot_start":      "ISO8601",
            "slot_end":        "ISO8601",
            "overlap_score":   float,       # 0.0 – 1.0
            "free_count":      int,
            "total_count":     int,
            "partial":         bool,        # True if overlap_score < 1.0
            "busy_participants": list[str], # names of participants who are busy
        }

Spec compliance:
    - Inherits BaseStep
    - run() signature: (self, envelope: dict, config: dict) -> StepResult
    - Never raises — all exceptions caught and returned as StepResult(success=False)
    - Never modifies envelope directly
    - Never adds fields to StepResult
    - Never writes to SQLite — runner does that
    - Uses resolve_path() from core.envelope for all envelope reads
