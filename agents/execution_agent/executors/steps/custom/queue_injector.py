Custom step — Onboarding Coordinator (Agent 09)
P5 responsibility

What it does:
    Reads the tooling list fetched by the preceding DBExtractor step.
    For each tool in the list, creates a new task envelope and inserts it into
    the SQLite task queue so the Account Manager agent can pick it up independently.

    This is the async connection pattern from spec Section 7.2.
    The Onboarding Coordinator does NOT wait for Account Manager to finish.
    It fires the tasks and moves on.

    One envelope is created per tool. Each envelope is a minimal valid Phase 1-style
    envelope that the Account Manager can process:
        - intake:   department=IT, task_type=access_provisioning, isAutonomous=True
        - task:     employee details + tool name + manager as requester
        - priority: score=3 (medium) by default for access provisioning tasks

Returns:
    StepResult.data = {
        "tasks_injected":  int,
        "task_ids":        list[str],   # one task_id per injected envelope
        "target_agent":    str,
        "tools_queued":    list[str],   # tool names that were successfully queued
        "tools_failed":    list[str],   # tool names that failed to queue (DB error)
    }

Spec compliance:
    - Inherits BaseStep
    - run() signature: (self, envelope: dict, config: dict) -> StepResult
    - Never raises — all exceptions caught and returned as StepResult(success=False)
    - Never modifies envelope directly
    - Never adds fields to StepResult
    - Writes to SQLite task queue ONLY — this is the one step permitted to write to
      the queue table because its entire purpose is async task injection.
      It does NOT write to the envelope table — that is still the runner's job.
    - Uses resolve_path() from core.envelope for all envelope reads
