Agent 08 — Expense Tracker
approval: none  |  on_failure: escalate

DBExtractor is mocked for both tests: data/office.db exists but has no
finance_expense_reports table, so a live query raises OperationalError.

Two scenarios are tested:

1. test_08_expense_tracker_clean
   No anomaly detected → run_if on send_status_reply passes → EmailDispatcher
   sends status reply in dry-run mode → status="completed".

2. test_08_expense_tracker_anomaly
   Anomaly detected (duplicate + missing receipt) → run_if on send_status_reply
   evaluates to False → step is skipped → agent still completes but no email
   is sent → status="completed", send_status_reply absent from execution.steps.
