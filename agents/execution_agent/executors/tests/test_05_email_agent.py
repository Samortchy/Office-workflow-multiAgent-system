Agent 05 — Email Agent
approval: single_confirm_if_low_confidence  |  on_failure: escalate

Step 1 (summarise_attachments) is skipped via run_if: task.has_attachments not in envelope.
Steps 2-3 (draft_reply, score_confidence) are mocked LLMGenerator calls.
Step 4 (compliance_check) uses DBExtractor service mock — no DB needed.
Step 5 (send_email dispatcher): approval gate fires.
  - Gate reads execution.result.draft_confidence (never set by any step).
  - Missing confidence → gate pauses with "approval_pending".
Expected terminal status: "approval_pending".
